# ME250 S19 Project 3

**Project 3: Color Sorter** for ME 250 at the University of Illinois at Chicago for the Spring 2019 semester.

This repository contains:
  - all Arduino (.ino) files used, either for testing or for the final product,
  - all CAD models (misc SolidWorks extensions), with different stages of development grouped seperately, and
  - all LaTeX files (.tex, .png for inset images) used to generate the final report.
  
This project was made using Arduino, SolidWorks, Notepad++, and Overleaf.

Although this repository was created by me, some of its contents were made by other members of Group 17, and many other parts of the project could not have been done without their help.
